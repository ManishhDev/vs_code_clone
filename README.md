# vs_code_clone
 I built a frontend clone of the VS Code homepage to improve my skills in HTML and CSS. Working on this project helped me learn how to structure a webpage, style different sections, and understand the basics of responsive design. It was a great hands-on way to apply what I've learned so far.
